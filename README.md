# OOP_demo

This is an OOP demonstration for my students first view of the powers of OOP using the Pokedex as an example.

The Pokedex is an encyclopedia of fictional characters called Pokemon. The goal is to make an application that can find a specific Pokemon based on their name or ID and display their properties to the user. Previously the students have made a version without OOP at all, making the code very cluttered. In this example we try to improve the first version to an OOP version with more structure.
